      <p>Am currently a student at the <a href="http://www.jkuat.ac.ke/">Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology .</a>pursuing a
         degree in <em>BSc Mechatronics Engineering</em>.</p>

      <p>Am also a student at <a href="http://moringaschool.com/">Moringa School .</a>Currently learning Web development and Programming.</p>

      <p>Some of the reasons am taking a class in Programming inlude:
        <ol>
          <li>Coding ability gives new perspective to problem solving.Learning to code has the inadvertent effect of teaching you how to think.</li>
          <li>Learning to code can help open up new areas of opportunity in your career and ultimately make you a more flexible candidate in a rapidly-shifting digital economy. </li>
          <li>Another great benefit of learning coding is that you will automatically become more aware of how websites work, for example. Also, youâ€™ll understand how applications are built.</li>
